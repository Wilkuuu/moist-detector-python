# MicroPython ESP32 Requirements
# These are built-in modules, no external installation needed

# Core modules used:
# - network: For WiFi connectivity
# - urequests: For HTTP requests (built-in in MicroPython)
# - time: For delays and timing
# - machine: For hardware control

# Note: MicroPython on ESP32 includes these modules by default
# No pip install needed - just flash the firmware and upload the code
